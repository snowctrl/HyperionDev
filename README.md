# finalCapstone

## This folder contains 'Capstone' projects created as key learning demonstrations during the HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp I recently completed:

### T51_Capstone.ipynb - an exploration of the use of PCA with cluster-analysis-based machine learning.
T51_CompulsoryTask.ipynb explores the use of PCA to reduce dimensionality in machine learning, based on an exploration of the USarrests.csv dataset, also included here for convenience.  It should be noted that USarrests is not a good choice for Principal Component Analysis, as it contains few features, meaning minimal need for PCA.  But ultimately more importantly the clusters created tell us little useful about the data. In other words, what use is it to group the US States represented into two groups?  What useful information can be inferred from this?  What does it actually tell us?  At some point soon I will update this demonstration task to use a much more worthy dataset.

### T46_Capstone.ipynb - an exploration of the use of machine learning to recognise numbers in images

### T39_Capstone.py - an exploration of SQL and SQLite in Python that runs a bookstore database
T39_Capstone.py allows a SQL databse of books to be searched, added to, etc.  When first run it loads the file initial_books.csv if the file ebookstore.sqlite is not present in the same folder, to create the initial databse of books.

### T36_Capstone.py - an EDA of the wine.csv dataset
