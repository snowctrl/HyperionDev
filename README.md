# finalCapstone

## This folder contains 'Capstone' projects created as key learning demonstrations during the HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp I recently completed:

### T51_Capstone.ipynb - an exploration of the use of PCA with cluster-analysis-based machine learning.
T51_CompulsoryTask.ipynb explores the use of principle component analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality in machine learning, based on an exploration of the USarrests.csv dataset, also included here for convenience.

### T46_Capstone.ipynb - an exploration of the use of machine learning to recognise numbers in images.

### T39_Capstone.py - an exploration of SQL and SQLite in Python that runs a bookstore database.
T39_Capstone.py allows a SQL databse of books to be searched, added to, etc.  When first run it loads the file initial_books.csv if the file ebookstore.sqlite is not present in the same folder, to create the initial databse of books.

### T36_Capstone.py - an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the wine.csv dataset
