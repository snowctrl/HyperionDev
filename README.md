An exploration of the use of PCA with cluster-analysis-based machine learning.

This was my submission for the final task of the HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp, that summarises much of the learning that has taken place.  The file 'T51 CompulsoryTask.ipynb' explores the use of PCA to reduce dimensionality in machine learning, based on an exploration of the USarrests.csv dataset, also included here for convenience.

It should be noted that USarrests is not a good choice for Principal Component Analysis, as it contains few features, meaning minimal need for PCA.  But ultimately more importantly the clusters created tell us little useful abnout the data. In other words, what use is it to group the US States represented into two groups?  What useful information can be inferred from this?  What does it actually tell us?

At some point soon I will update this demonstration task to use a much more worthy dataset.
